# WordleGame
Creating the popular Wordle Game with Python. This version of game is dynamic enough to work with any corpus you feed in and you can set the length of word to guess and number of tries. The default version has a 5 letter words corpus with 6 tries, like in the original world. This is functional and an interactive version with a front-end will be released soon!

To play the game, run Wordle-Game.py and start guessing!
